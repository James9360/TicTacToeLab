# TicTacToeLab
Lab from Class 4/4 on Chapter 14

Create TicTacToe with your partner using JavaFX.  The Game logic should be implemented in a Game class.  The Application and Controller classes should not contain game logic, but should call methods in a Game object.  Check the TicTacToe.png file for a rough UML diagram.
